# lost's dotfiles

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

These are my .config dotfiles. They include my dotfiles for:
fish
bash
i3
vim

Note: The bash and the vim config (.bashrc and .vimrc) might not show up. This is because the file starts with a dot, which on Linux Systems, shows up as a hidden file.

These dotfiles probably will work on any distro, but just in case, the distro I use is fedora.

Requires: i3 dmenu vim (and VimPlug) bash and fish.
